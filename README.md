# Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2 ARD code list



![logos](images/Logos_updated.png)  


A curated list supporting the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 analysis-ready data (ARD) in the UK

---

# Project Background
[JNCC](https://jncc.gov.uk/) are leading a project to help people use [Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1) and [Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) analysis-ready data ([ARD](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/simple-ard-service-faqs/)) provided by the [Defra EO Data Service](https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/06/18/making-it-easier-to-access-and-use-earth-observation-data/) and the [CEDA Archive](http://archive.ceda.ac.uk/), with a particular focus on accessing data via API (application programming interfaces).  As part of this project, we have set up a public repository for sharing code in any language for processing or analysing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 ARD.  We conducted a survey in July 2020 to gain a better understanding of user needs and inform the choice of code-sharing platform.  Based on the survey results and subsequent discussion with the project team and partners, it was agreed that the best option was to set up this curated list on GitHub.  We have also set up a Slack workspace to enable discussion and messaging between users of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 ARD; you can [join the group here](https://S1-S2-ARD-users.slack.com/) if you have a Slack account, or [sign up here](https://join.slack.com/t/s1-s2-ard-users/signup) if you do not yet have a Slack account. 

# How to contribute
This list is a work in progress and we need your help to keep it up-to-date!  If you have examples of code for selecting, downloading, manipulating or analysing Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 ARD, please add them to the list by making a pull request.  See our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to do this.

There are separate workflows for [English sites](https://github.com/jncc/cuu-change-detection/blob/master/CUUCD_EnglishSites.Rmd), [Welsh sites](https://github.com/jncc/cuu-change-detection/blob/master/CUUCD_WelshSites.Rmd) and [Scottish sites](https://github.com/jncc/cuu-change-detection/blob/master/CUUCD_ScottishSites.Rmd). `R` `JNCC` `copernicus-user-uptake`

### Peatland Mapping
#### Nature.Scot bare peat mapping
- [Bare peat mapping - creating indices](https://github.com/duncansnh/Bare-peat/blob/master/bare_peat_indices.r).  Calculates various indices for bare peat mapping vectors too large to apply in one script, therefore carried out with single raster at a time, controlled input by moving rasters between folders on remote sensing drive. `R` `Nature.Scot`
- [Bare peat mapping - creating indices](https://github.com/duncansnh/Bare-peat/blob/master/Indices_creation.ipynb).  Creates indices from ARD of 10 bands from Sentinel-2. Creates 23 band raster (float 32). `Python` `Nature.Scot`
- [Bare peat mapping – random forest classification](https://github.com/duncansnh/Bare-peat/blob/master/bare.peat.national.RF.classification.R).  The script reads an ESRI Shapefile (defined by the "shapefile" variable) with training polygons and then selects a user-determined number of samples from each land cover type. A multilayer image that contains spectral, other continuous data or categorical data is also input. For each randomly selected sample the data values for that pixel are determined and these data are used to run the Random Forest model. After building the model the multilayer image is read, and up to three output layers can be selected for the output image. `R` `Nature.Scot`
- [Bare peat mapping – random forest classification](https://github.com/duncansnh/Bare-peat/blob/master/Data_Split_Classification_.ipynb).  Script to perform supervised classification. Applied to bare peat classification on nationwide scale using Sentinel-2. `Python` `Nature.Scot`
#### JNCC Bare Peat Mapper app 
- ['CUUPeatApp_map_prep'](https://github.com/jncc/cuu-peatland-mapping/blob/master/scripts/CUUPeatApp_map_prep.R).  Prepares Sentinel-2 and bare peat layers for use in the Bare Peat Mapper app, using functions provided in the ['habitat-condition-monitoring'](https://github.com/jncc/habitat-condition-monitoring) package. `R` `JNCC` `copernicus-user-uptake`

### Burn mapping
Code developed by Nature.Scot as part of the Copernicus User Uptake project on upland burn mapping from Sentinel 2.
The code has been developed in Python in Jupyter notebooks designed to work in a Google Colabs environment, though it should only need minor changes to work in other environments.  Project still in progress so code may change.
